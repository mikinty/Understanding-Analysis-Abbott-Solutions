\chapter*{Acknowledgment}
I would like to thank Varun Gudibanda and Trajan Hammonds for giving
me the inspiration for writing these solutions by hyping up Real Analysis.
They also contributed to some solutions in chapter 1 and 2.

I would also like to thank Stephen Abbott for writing a fantastic introductory text to Real Analysis.
If he ever reads this, he's probably wondering why someone would write solutions to his text if it already
exists, but I hope he's happy to know someone learned a lot while doing it.
