# Understanding Analysis Solutions

These are unofficial solutions for _Understanding Analysis_ by Abbott.
I started these solutions since I was self-studying real analysis,
and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing
out solutions.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR!

## Why should I read this?

While the official solutions may be more accurate, they may be dense and hard
to understand, so a different perspective may help. In addition, my solutions
were done mostly independently of the official solutions, so it may be useful
to see how a student tries to approach problems.

I've also provided diagrams for certain problems, which can also help
understand more complex topics. Some sections have some introductory text, which further explains certain
topics. Typos are also noted.

There is also an appendix, which highlights several important theorems,
identities, and proof-writing tips. It can be used as a study guide for
current students taking Real Analysis.

## TODOs

I use `\TODO` to mark the problems that need work or don't have solutions.
There are also `TODO` comments if there are more minor parts that need work, e.g. spacing or prettier formatting.
